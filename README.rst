bcloud-core is a fork of `bcloud <https://github.com/LiuLang/bcloud>`_.

Advanced features such as beatiful Gtk GUI, secure keyring, intelligent file 
manager, localization were all trimmed.
Only core api logic was kept intending to minimize requirement.

For daily usage, the upstream is highly recommended.
